# Rebuttal letter writing TIPS
* First of all, please think reviewers' comments are very very valuable (even some of them look stupid). They volunteered to review the paper with their valuable time. Please respect reviewers' comments as much as possible
  * If the reviewers' comments are based on their misunderstanding, **this is still your fault**. Please try to clarify where the reviewer misunderstands
    * e.g., "We apologize that our experimental section does not emphasize the condition of ..." etc.
    * Please do not just say that the reviewers' comments are wrong... I often saw these cases when I reviewed a paper, and I just felt very negative about this paper.
* Try to always modify your paper according to any reviewer comments
  * Please do not only answer the question. The rebuttal is not a place for you and the reviewers to enjoy the research discussion. We have to convince them of our approach and provide how we reflect them to improve our paper's quality, given their valuable comments.
  * In addition to your answers to the questions/comments, please **declare** how you rewrite your paper briefly and concretely.
    * e.g., "<your answers>. We will revise Section 2.X based on this answer."
* If the reviewer asked for additional experiments, we should at least try to initiate these experiments and tell them that we are seriously thinking of these additional experimental comments and will add them to the paper if they are finished on time. It is OK if it is not finished or it does have some positive results finally. 


# Reply letter writing TIPS
* Please acknowledge all reviewer comments
* If a reviewer points out one issue that can be applicable to the other parts, please try to find them and fix them (and appeal to them that you are following their suggestions more than they pointed out.).
* Reviewer's misunderstanding is still your fault. Please think of a better presentation of this misunderstanding part and rewrite it.
* A reply letter should include
  * The question from the reviewer
  * The original documentation (optional, but it would be better to include it)
  * The revised documentation
  * With this, the reply letter becomes self-consistent. The reviewer does not have to check the original paper, revised paper, and reply letter. They can just check everything with one reply letter, which makes it easier for them to re-review our paper.
  * see my reply letter example [reply_v3.pdf](https://github.com/shinjiwJHU/lab_activities/files/6385640/reply_v3.pdf)
* Please also emphasize your modified part in the revised paper.
