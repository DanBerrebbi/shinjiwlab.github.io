### What can I expect following my interview? What are my chances for being accepted?

After we finish the interviews, The committee combines the information from the interviews to form a complete picture of the applicants. We consider the overall quality, as well as fit with our lab and the research diversity of the lab. We also consider applications from students who have previously not worked in speech processing.

This process takes a few weeks, after which we notify students if they have been accepted, waitlisted, or rejected. Additionally, not all offers are sent at the same time. If someone else receives an offer and you haven’t heard yet, don’t be discouraged!

### What should I do following my interviews?

Keep us informed of your status. If you are considering offers from other labs or have any deadlines specific to your program, please let us know. We try to move quickly, but we don’t want to lose a candidate who thinks that they won’t get in because they haven’t heard back yet.

### What are potential projects?

We work on almost every aspect of speech processing, from frontends like speech enhancement to speech recognition and text to speech, as well as downstream tasks like speech translation and spoken language understanding. The research projects assigned to you depend on your interest and are decided after you are accepted into our lab.
