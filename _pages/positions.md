Thank you for considering working with us!

Our lab has open and collaborative minds and often has various opportunities, including postdocs, visitors, and Ph.D. students. 
We want applicants to have solid fundamentals and interests in one or more of the following topics:

- Automatic speech recognition
- Speech enhancement and separation
- Spoken language understanding
- Machine learning for speech and language processing

Solid programming skills and open-source experiences are also preferred.

However, we also consider the research diversity. We're interested in expertise outside the above topics or other unique experiences, which can be applied to speech and audio problems.

Please see the following for details of each application category.

### Postdoc
- Currently, we have an opening position in [link](https://cmu.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/CMU/job/Pittsburgh-PA/Postdoctoral-Research-Associate---Language-Technologies-Institute--LTI---SCS_2016892).
- If you're interested in the position, we suggest you to have the following actions. **Note that we would not respond to all applications.**
- [ ] &nbsp; Please email your CV to shinjiw@ieee.org with the subject **"WAVLab postdoc applications"**.

This period would be at least the first couple of months or longer. We believe that this is an essential process for you to start a solid research activity. If you want to publish a paper as soon as possible, our lab is not the best option for you, unfortunately. I recommend you to contact the other faculties.
